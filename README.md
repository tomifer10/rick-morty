WELCOME TO THE RICK AND MORTY DIMENSION!  ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
- How to use this app:

This application is very easy and intuitive to use. You can see that you have all the episodes of the series in the navigation bar on the left side of the page, and you can navigate through it using the scroll.
 Clicking on the episode you are interested in will display in the center of the page the information about that episode, and the characters that appear. But that's not all! if you are interested in a particular character you can click on his or her personal card and it will show you all the information about that character.


- Issues:

During the development of the application I realized how important it is to maintain a good planning of the app. Regardless of the fact that during the process you have to be flexible to change on the fly, I think it is essential to have a development strategy to follow a particular path.
 I also found it challenging and at the same time exciting to combine all the previous knowledge in a single project, as you can see how necessary is the daily practice to maintain everything.
A challenging and revealing part of these projects is to translate the previous understanding and idea of what I want from the site into code. Seeing how it takes shape, and the changes that need to be made on the fly.
Perhaps on a technical level, the difficulties came from implementing Typescript with little experience. But it's also fun and it takes a lot of effort to do your own research and learning to master the language.

- Lessons:

Leaving aside all the lessons learned on a technical level, which were many thanks to reusing things seen a long time ago, and seeing how everything fits together, I think I could summarize the biggest learning from the implementation of this app in 4: understand, plan, do it, and stay flexible.
